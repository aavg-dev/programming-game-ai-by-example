Programming Game AI by Example - C# & Unity Engine(2020.3.39)
==========================
* This is a fork from another project made for learning purposes. 
-------------------------------------------------------
* For Usage of code and Unity Engine for this project in detail, please visit **"WIKI"**.
-------------------------------------------------------
* This repos covers [ https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Example-Wordware-Developers-Library/dp/1556220782 ] .
* I've been converting this book's C++ code to Unity C# for studying purpose! 
* I hope this repos to help out who want to know about basic(but actually **hard**) GAME AI like me.
---------------------------------------------------------

# 2. West World Project.
* The west world project covers FSM, and TELEGRAM for event-driven game system.
# 3. Steering Behavior.
* The Steering Behaviors covers Basic steering like Seek, Evade, Impose, offset pursuit, etc., and Group Steering like seperate, alignment, cohesion.
* In this project, I didn't implement a code from after Flocking paragraph to the end.
# 4. Simple Soccer.
* The Simple Soccer project covers Steering and FSM systems.
* This project reveals that how we can calculate a 'Best Supporting Spot', 'Pass or Shoot mechanism' and following 'State' what Player should have. 
* The Youtube video link of this chapter is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkzPBJMhQC8&t
# 5. Secret of graph.
* This chapter describes that calculating Shortest path methods by using DSF, BSF, Dijkstra and A* algorithms.
* I didn't post any of the context in this chapter because those algorithms are very famous, and also It is too much for me to describe all of those algorithm mechanism.
# 6~9. The Raven.
* Plan to post later.
# 10. Puzzy Logic.
* Plan to post later.
